# Bitmap Transformer

This application takes a bit map image and applies four transformations to it, creating four additional files in the assets directory.

  - Greyscale
  - Infared
  - Inverted Color
  - Reversed (a flipped image)

# Run it!

  - open the file in the terminal
  - navigate to the Lib directory
  - run the command node bitmap-file-helper.js
  - At this point you'll have 4 new files in your assets directory.
